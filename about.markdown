My name is Joshua Isaiah Thomas (no relation to the famous Pistons point guard). I was born in Jacksonville, Florida but grew up in a multitude of cities across the country. My track record includes Jacksonville, Florida; Orlando, Florida; Moscow, Idaho; Louisville, Kentucky; and Spokane, Washington. For a lot of people moving that much probably seems like a major hassle; however, I believe that it’s my ‘rolling stone’ up bringing that’s made me the man I am today and given me some of the opportunities I’ve been blessed with thus far. As far as hobbies are concerned, I play basketball, reading, lifting, drawing, video games, anime, manga, and enjoying the outdoors.
