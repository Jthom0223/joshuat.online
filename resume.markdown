Welcome to my resume. It's important to me that you can see the care and time I put into all my projects and work and I hope my resume can drive that idea home. I possess a wide range of skillsets, from graphic design, to web design, all the way to user experience. With every project, beginning to end, I maintain active communication with my clients, as it is my personal belief that ample communication and feedback are the keys to successful design. I have a myriad of different experiences in different areas ranging from interning in graphic design for Gonzaga University to interning in user experience design at Itron Inc. I look forward to working with you in the future and hope I can help you fulfill your next design goals with creativity, ease, and efficiency.
